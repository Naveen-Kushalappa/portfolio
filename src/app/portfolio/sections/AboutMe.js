      Hello and welcome to my online resume! I&apos;m Naveen, and I&apos;m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. 
      With a strong foundation across organizations and team sizes, I have a diverse background in application development.
      However, I&apos;m language-agnostic and open to tackling challenges outside my comfort zone.
      <br /> <br />My experience in the tech industry has been truly incredible, allowing me to acquire invaluable skills from outstanding colleagues. These skills enable me to tackle challenges daily.
      I excel in collaborative environments and enjoy working alongside like-minded, passionate professionals.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you like to discuss potential opportunities, please don&apos;t hesitate to get in touch!
